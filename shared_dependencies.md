Shared Dependencies:

1. Scrapy: All the files in the scraper directory will use Scrapy, a Python framework for web scraping.

2. IndeedSpider: The main spider class defined in "indeed_spider.py" will be used by "main.py" to initiate the scraping process.

3. JobItem: This is the data schema defined in "items.py" that will be used by "indeed_spider.py" to structure the scraped data and by "pipelines.py" to process the data.

4. JsonWriterPipeline: This is the pipeline class defined in "pipelines.py" that will be used by "settings.py" to specify the item pipelines.

5. ITEM_PIPELINES: This is a Scrapy setting defined in "settings.py" that will be used by Scrapy to determine which pipelines to run.

6. DOM Element IDs: "indeed_spider.py" will use the IDs of DOM elements to locate the data on the web page. These IDs include but are not limited to: 'jobsearch-JobComponent-description', 'jobsearch-JobComponent-title', 'jobsearch-ViewJobLayout-company', 'jobsearch-ViewJobLayout-location'.

7. output.json: This is the file where the scraped data will be stored. It will be used by "pipelines.py" to write the data and by "main.py" to specify the output file.

8. start_requests, parse, parse_job: These are function names used in "indeed_spider.py" for initiating requests, handling responses, and parsing job details respectively. 

9. process_item: This is a function name used in "pipelines.py" to process each item scraped by the spider.
